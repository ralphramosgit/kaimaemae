      "Plotted from the enterococcus column in master_dataset.csv. The log1p transform is log(x + 1), which handles zero values without breaking. The red dashed BAV line is drawn at the log1p of 130 (the EPA Beach Action Value). Both histograms use the same sample set of 32,620 rows.",
    insights: [
      "On the raw scale, over 96% of samples are compressed into the first bar near zero, making the distribution unlearnable for a regressor.",
      "The log transform spreads values across the full range and reveals a multi-modal structure that the model can actually fit.",
      "The BAV line sits far to the right of the main mass, confirming that dangerous readings are rare outliers in the dataset and reinforcing the class imbalance problem.",

      "Computed as a simple value count of the binary unsafe column in master_dataset.csv. No modelling involved; this is a raw count of the training labels produced by the data preparation pipeline.",
    insights: [
      "Only 1 in 27 samples is unsafe. A naive classifier that always predicts safe would score 96.3% accuracy while catching zero unsafe days.",
      "Standard accuracy is a completely meaningless metric for this problem. Recall and PR AUC are the right measures.",
      "The imbalance ratio of 25.8:1 directly sets XGBoost's scale_pos_weight = 22.63, which makes each unsafe training sample count as 22 safe samples in the loss function.",
      "Random Forest addresses this identically using class_weight='balanced', which reweights each sample inversely proportional to its class frequency.",

    howProduced:
      "The rain_7day column in master_dataset.csv was binned using pd.cut() into those 7 ranges. The unsafe rate per bin was computed as mean(unsafe) multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. No model was involved; this is a direct aggregation of the training data.",
    insights: [
      "The unsafe rate rises monotonically from 1.4% (dry spell) to 20.9% (100mm+), a 15x increase. This confirms the research hypothesis before any model is trained.",
      "Even at 100mm+, only 21% of samples are unsafe. Rainfall is strongly predictive but not deterministic. Beach location, drainage infrastructure, tidal state, and dilution all play roles the model cannot see.",
      "The step between 25-50mm and 50-100mm (7% to 10.6%) is smaller than expected, suggesting a saturation effect where additional rainfall has diminishing marginal impact on contamination.",
      "This figure is the clearest single justification for the whole project. If rainfall had no relationship to exceedance rate, none of the modelling would make sense.",
      "The modest slope explains the honest ROC AUC of 0.665. A stronger signal would produce a higher ceiling. The model is only as good as the underlying relationship allows.",

    insights: [
      "R2 = -0.105 means the regressor performs worse than simply predicting the training mean for every sample. It has not learned a useful function.",
      "Predictions cluster around 2.0 log units regardless of actual values. The model learned the average behavior across all conditions but not the extreme values that matter most.",
      "Most truly unsafe samples (right of the vertical BAV line) are predicted below the BAV (below the horizontal line). The regressor systematically under-predicts high readings.",
      "This is why the regressor is kept only as a secondary continuous bacteria estimate in the app, not for safety decisions. The XGB classifier is deployed instead.",

Importance type 'gain' is preferred over 'weight' (split count) because it measures actual predictive value, not just usage frequency.",
    insights: [
      "rain_48hr is the single most important feature (relative importance 0.22), slightly ahead of rain_24hr (0.21). The 24-48 hour window captures the peak of urban runoff reaching the coast after a storm.",
      "Month ranks 3rd (0.14), above rain_72hr. Seasonal context is more predictive than the 3-day total, showing that the same amount of rain is more dangerous in winter when soil saturation and baseline water levels are higher.",
      "days_since_rain is least important (0.07), likely because its information is largely redundant with rain_24hr being zero. Dry spell duration adds marginal signal once recent rain is already known.",
      "All 7 features contribute meaningfully with no near-zero values. This validates that each rainfall window captures a distinct and useful aspect of contamination risk.",
      "The dominance of short-window features (24hr and 48hr) over long-window ones (7day) is consistent with the known physics of urban runoff: bacteria load peaks 1-3 days after rain, not a week later.",

      "True negatives: 4,796. Safe days correctly identified. The model is very good at recognizing safe conditions.",
      "False positives: 963. Safe days incorrectly flagged as unsafe. This is a 20% false alarm rate among safe days, which is acceptable for a public health screening tool that prioritizes catching dangerous days.",
      "False negatives: 52. Unsafe days the model completely missed. These are the dangerous outcomes: beaches that should have been flagged were not.",
      "True positives: 32. Of the 84 truly unsafe test days, the model caught 32 (recall = 38%). It misses 62% of unsafe days, but this is a real improvement over zero detection.",

      "PR-AUC 0.072 vs the 0.014 baseline, 5x better than random on the PR curve. The low absolute value is not a failure; it directly reflects how difficult precision is at a 3.7% base rate.",
      "Using predicted probabilities rather than hard binary predictions produces smoother curves. The model has genuine confidence gradients, not just on/off outputs.",

      "All three models were evaluated on the same held-out test set (2014 onward). The regressor was converted to binary predictions by applying expm1() to inverse the log transform, then thresholding at 130 CFU. sklearn.metrics computed all four scores for each model.",
    insights: [
      "The XGB Regressor has near-zero recall (0.012) despite having the same ROC AUC as the others. Optimizing for mean regression error is fundamentally the wrong objective for rare-event detection.",
      "All three models share nearly identical ROC AUC of about 0.665. The predictive ceiling is set by the data, not the model; all three models extract approximately the same total signal from 7 rainfall features.",
      "The key differentiator is recall: XGB Classifier (38%) vs Random Forest (26%) vs Regressor (1%). The classifier was selected because scale_pos_weight directly trains it to catch unsafe days.",
      "Random Forest is a close second and could be deployed. Its lower recall (26%) means it would miss more unsafe days, making it less appropriate for a safety-focused tool.",

    howProduced:
      "beach_catalog.csv was filtered to beaches with n >= 100 samples, sorted by exceed_rate descending, and the top 15 were plotted. The exceedance rate for each beach is simply the fraction of its historical samples that exceeded 130 CFU.",
    insights: [
      "McCully Street Bridge (59%) and Ala Moana Bridge (48%) are not ocean swimming beaches. They are freshwater stream monitoring points in the DOH dataset that receive direct stormwater discharge. Their extreme rates reflect structural contamination, not weather-driven risk.",
      "Kahana Bay Beach (21%) is a genuine ocean swimming beach with unusually high risk due to its location at the mouth of Kahana Stream on the Windward coast.",
      "These historical rates feed directly into the Bayesian probability scaling in the live app. A beach with twice the island average exceedance rate gets twice the odds of being unsafe for any given storm scenario.",
      "The wide range from 3% to 59% confirms that treating all 84 beaches identically would produce misleading results. Individual beach history is essential for meaningful risk distribution.",
      "Beaches with fewer than 100 samples were excluded because a beach with 5 clean samples showing 0% exceedance tells us almost nothing; the Bayesian prior pulls sparse beaches toward the island average.",

          Predicting beach water safety from rainfall on Oahu
        </h2>

        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ocean-200">
          <p>
            Hawaii&apos;s beach water quality is primarily driven by nonpoint source pollution carried
            by stormwater runoff. When it rains, bacteria, sediment, and sewage overflow from
            streams, storm drains, and agriculture wash into the nearshore ocean. The Hawaii
            Department of Health Clean Water Branch monitors 84 beaches across Oahu and issues
            advisories when enterococcus bacteria exceed 130 CFU/100 mL, the EPA Beach Action Value (BAV).
            The problem is that sampling is infrequent (roughly weekly), so there are many days
            between measurements where the true safety status is unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project asks a specific question: can we predict whether a water sample would
            exceed 130 CFU based only on recent rainfall data? If rainfall is predictive enough,
            we can fill in the gaps between measurements and provide a real-time risk estimate on
            days when no sample exists. The answer is yes, but with important caveats.
          </p>
          <p>
            The master dataset joins 34 years of DOH water quality samples (32,620 rows,
            1990-2024) with antecedent rainfall from 35 rain gauges matched to each beach via
            Haversine distance. Seven rainfall features were engineered: precipitation totals
            over the prior 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days; the maximum single-day
            rainfall in any 3-day window; the number of days since measurable rain last fell;
            and calendar month as a seasonality proxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dataset has a critical class imbalance: only 3.7% of samples are unsafe (1,217
            of 32,620). This is not a data quality problem but a real feature of the system.
            Oahu&apos;s beaches are safe the vast majority of the time. But it means that standard
            accuracy is a useless metric and any model that ignores the imbalance will simply
            learn to predict safe for every input and score 96.3% accuracy while catching
            zero unsafe days. All three models trained here explicitly correct for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The train/test split is strictly time-based: all samples before 2014 form the
            training set (26,777 rows) and all samples from 2014 onward form the test set
            (5,843 rows, 84 unsafe). This is intentional. A random split would allow future
            observations to inform the model&apos;s training, inflating performance estimates and
            hiding whether the model can generalize to genuinely unseen conditions. A time-based
            split is the honest evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three models were trained: an XGBoost Regressor targeting continuous log1p(CFU),
            an XGBoost Classifier targeting the binary unsafe label, and a Random Forest
            Classifier as a baseline. The XGBoost Classifier was selected for deployment
            because it achieved the highest recall (38%) and the highest PR AUC (0.072), the
            two metrics that matter most when catching rare dangerous events is the goal.
            The regressor is retained as a secondary estimate of bacterial concentration
            displayed alongside the binary prediction in the live application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Island-wide model probabilities are then distributed to individual beaches using
            Bayesian scaling. Each beach has a historical exceedance rate computed from its
            full DOH sample history. A beach with double the island-average historical rate
            gets double the adjusted probability for any given rainfall scenario. This preserves
            the model&apos;s core prediction while accounting for the fact that some beaches are
            structurally riskier than others regardless of rainfall.

          <p>
            XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially.
            Each new tree is trained to correct the mistakes made by all the trees that came before it.
            This process is called boosting: instead of training 400 independent trees and averaging them
            (like Random Forest), XGBoost trains them one at a time, each focusing on the residual errors
            of the previous ensemble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each individual tree is a shallow, weak learner. With max depth = 4, each tree can make at most
            4 sequential splits, which is just enough to learn simple interactions between features (e.g.,
            &quot;rain_48hr is high AND month is November&quot;) without memorizing specific training examples.
            The learning rate of 0.05 means that each new tree contributes only 5% of its full prediction
            to the ensemble, forcing the model to learn incrementally over many trees rather than fitting
            large corrections in a few steps. This is a form of regularization that prevents overfitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            For binary classification, XGBoost optimizes logistic loss (log loss). Each sample produces a
            raw score that is passed through a sigmoid function to produce a probability between 0 and 1.
            At prediction time, a threshold of 0.5 is used: probabilities above 0.5 are labeled unsafe.
            Because the true unsafe rate in the test set is only 1.4% (84 unsafe out of 5,843), using 0.5
            as a threshold is aggressive. Most predictions are near zero, and the model has to push a
            score above 0.5 only when rainfall patterns strongly resemble historical unsafe conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scale_pos_weight parameter is the key to making classification work. Without it, the
            log-loss function treats each unsafe sample the same as each safe sample. Because there are
            22.63 safe samples for every unsafe sample, the model would learn that predicting safe for
            everything minimizes loss. Setting scale_pos_weight = 22.63 tells XGBoost to treat each
            unsafe sample as 22.63 times more important in the loss function. This forces the model to
            devote real learning capacity to the unsafe minority class.

          <p>
            On the test set (2014 onward, 5,843 samples), the classifier correctly identified
            32 of the 84 truly unsafe days (recall = 38.1%). It generated 963 false positives:
            safe days that were incorrectly flagged. The confusion matrix shows true negatives
            at 4,796 and false negatives at 52.
          </p>
          <p>
            The precision of 3.2% is low but expected. With a base rate of only 1.4% unsafe
            in the test set, even a model that raises every alert based on a clear rainfall
            signal will have low precision because most rainy days do not produce unsafe water.
            The relevant comparison is PR AUC = 0.072 vs a baseline of 0.014, which is 5x
            better than a random classifier at the same threshold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feature importance from the trained model reveals that rain_48hr (0.22) and
            rain_24hr (0.21) account for nearly half the total predictive power. Month (0.14)
            ranks third, confirming that the same storm is more dangerous in November than
            in August. The 7-day total accounts for the remaining 11%, capturing the cumulative
            saturation effect of prolonged wet weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ROC AUC of 0.665 is the honest ceiling imposed by the data. Rainfall is a
            noisy proxy for bacterial contamination at a specific beach. Other drivers, including
            wildlife, ocean circulation, sediment resuspension, and sewer infrastructure,
            contribute to individual sample readings in ways that a rainfall model cannot see.
            A model that correctly identifies the signal that exists in the data, without
            overfitting to noise, is the right objective, and 0.665 reflects that signal.

        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ocean-700">
          <p>
            The XGB Regressor uses the same gradient boosting architecture as the classifier:
            400 trees built sequentially, each correcting the residual errors of the previous
            ensemble, with max depth 4 and learning rate 0.05. The critical difference is
            the objective function. Instead of log loss (which outputs a probability), the
            regressor minimizes squared error (reg:squarederror). Each prediction is a real number
            rather than a probability, representing the expected log1p(enterococcus) at a given
            beach under given rainfall conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The target variable is log1p(enterococcus) rather than raw CFU. This transformation
            is necessary because the raw enterococcus distribution is extremely right-skewed:
            96% of values cluster near zero while a handful of extreme readings (some above
            10,000 CFU) would dominate the mean squared error loss and force the model to
            overfit on outliers. log1p(x) = log(1 + x) maps this distribution into a more
            symmetric, learnable range. Predictions are inverted with expm1(y) = exp(y) - 1
            to recover the original scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crucially, the regressor does not use scale_pos_weight because it has no concept
            of safe vs unsafe classes. It simply fits a function from rainfall features to
            log-bacteria counts. The implication is that the loss function is dominated by
            the majority of samples near zero. Fitting those well minimizes RMSE, so the
            model learns to predict values near the mean of the training distribution rather
            than learning to predict the extreme values that actually exceed the BAV.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why converting the regressor to binary predictions by thresholding
            expm1(y_pred) at 130 produces recall of only 1.2%: the model systematically
            under-predicts high readings because they represent a tiny fraction of training loss.
            The regressor is structurally incapable of being a good rare-event detector
            without a mechanism equivalent to scale_pos_weight, which does not exist in
            standard regression.

        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ocean-700">
          <p>
            Random Forest builds an ensemble of decision trees independently and in parallel.
            This is the fundamental difference from XGBoost, which builds trees sequentially
            where each tree corrects the previous. In a Random Forest, each tree is trained
            on a bootstrap sample: a random sample of the training data with replacement,
            typically the same size as the training set. Because of replacement, each bootstrap
            sample includes roughly 63% of the original training rows and leaves out the rest
            (called the out-of-bag samples).
          </p>
          <p>
            At each node split, the Random Forest considers only a random subset of features
            rather than all features. With 7 features and the default setting of
            sqrt(7) = 2.65, each split considers roughly 2-3 randomly chosen features.
            This feature randomization is key: it forces trees to be diverse from each other.
            If all trees could use all features, they would all tend to split on the same
            most-informative feature first (rain_48hr), producing highly correlated trees
            whose ensemble adds little value. Restricting the feature set at each split
            forces different trees to explore different feature combinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final prediction is the majority vote across all 100 trees. For class
            probabilities (used in ROC and PR curves), the vote is the fraction of trees
            predicting unsafe. A sample predicted unsafe by 60 of 100 trees has a probability
            of 0.6. This averaging across diverse, partially-correlated trees is what makes
            Random Forest robust: individual trees overfit to their bootstrap sample, but
            the ensemble averages out the overfitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class imbalance is handled through class_weight=&apos;balanced&apos;. This parameter
            reweights each sample in the Gini impurity calculation at each node split,
            giving each unsafe sample a weight of approximately 22.63 (the inverse of its
            class frequency). This is mathematically equivalent to scale_pos_weight in
            XGBoost and produces the same effect: the tree-splitting criterion now treats
            a misclassified unsafe sample as 22.63 times more costly than a misclassified
            safe sample.
